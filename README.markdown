What Is It?
-----------

Countdown is a Mac OS X utility application that allows the user to pick from a set of pre-defined actions to execute when the timer reaches zero.

Features
--------

- Millisecond accuracy
- Seven pre-defined actions:
    1. Shut Down
    2. Restart
    3. Sleep
    4. Log Out
    5. Display dialog with custom text
    6. Beep and display dialog with custom text
    7. Execute custom shell script

Caveats
-------

- Mac OS X 10.6 only for now.
- Currently the _execute shell script_ action does not feature running a shell script from a saved file and therefore is rather limited.
- May not be in the best suited application form right now. 
Three possibilities for a different approach:
    1. Make Countdown a multi document app to be able to run multiple countdowns at the same time.  
    2. Countdown as a menu extra that is visible from the global menu bar could also make sense.   
    3. Implement Countdown as a HUD based panel that is always visible (Although I am not too big a fan of this approach).
